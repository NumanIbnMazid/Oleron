The jurisdiction of the High Court Division is not derived from the Letters Patent of 1862 or that of 1865, but from the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act (India) of 1891 and the Court of Admiralty Act 1861 of England.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Sonali Bank vs Bengal Liner Ltd. and others </em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Section 6- </strong>In an Admiralty Suit the plaintiff filed an application for extension of Bank guarantee which expired on 17-12-2001 by efflux of time.

It is an action in rem against the vessel and in personam against the other principal defendants.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Captain Khawja Bakhtyiar Saleem vs MV Delta Star and others </em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Section 5- </strong>On a clear reading of section 5 of the Act of 1861 the High Court Division is of the view that the judgment passed in decreeing the Admiralty Suit against the defendants ex parte cannot be said to have been passed without jurisdiction. In that regard, the High Court Division finds itself to be in agreement with Mr. Siddique&rsquo;s submission that the Admiralty Court having assumed jurisdiction under section 5 of the Act of 1861 to consider the claim of the plaintiff for supply of bunkers to the vessel &lsquo;MV Peleas K&rsquo;, section 230 of the Contract Act, 1872 cannot be said to have an application in these facts and cannot, therefore, be interpreted to have a co-extensive application with section 5 of the Act of 1861 for assumption of jurisdiction for passing a decree for claims arising from the supply of fuel to the vessel.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Fairdeal Marine Services vs &lsquo;MV Peleas K&rsquo;</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Section 5- </strong>The decree- holder- petitioner had a right to seek a comprehensive and complete relief the first time around, but having not done so, as is evident in the facts and circumstances of this case, shall not, therefore, have any avenue open to it for placing claims periodically at subsequent dates. Having thus failed to so fully exercise its right by execution of the entire Decree at one go the decree-holder-petitioner, and as is evident in the execution petition of 10-03-2005, having asked this Court to enforce the decree for the sum only of Taka 19,70,000, a sum lesser than the gross claimed amount of Taka 31,03,562.50 inclusive of interest, must now be taken to have accordingly waived the right to claim the balance amount of Taka 11,33,562.50. Requiring this Court to now allow satisfaction of the claim to the balance interest amount in the manner as sought in the application dated 25-09-2005 is tantamount to effectively asking this Court to innovate on the execution application and case which this Court is now reluctant to undertake in the facts and circumstances. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Fairdeal Marine Services vs &lsquo;MV Peleas K&rsquo;</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Section 6- </strong>The Exhibit- B has not been considered by the trail Court and failed to consider that the defendants delivered 15,891 tonnes of food grains at Chittagong and 9,271 tonnes of food grains at Chalna thus, the total quantity being of 25,132 tonnes of food grains (wheat) were delivered to the plaintiff. The plaintiff should not depend upon gross measurement of food grains contained in a bulk in a vessel of a surveyor. They should calculate the actual quantity of food grains. Thus the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court suffers from illegality and not sustainable in law.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Commerce Tanker Corporation vs Bangladesh </em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Section 6- </strong>It appears that the vessel &lsquo;MV Chosun Hope&rsquo; has not reached late in the discharge port and used its maximum speed and dispatch to reach discharge port within the stipulated period as made in the addendum of the charter party. The plaintiff did not suffer any loss as yet on the count of imposition of development surcharge on the consignment of Soda Ash Light as imported through the defendant&rsquo;s vessel which reached Chittagong Port on 26-06-1997. In view of the discussion and reasoning as above, this Court finds that the plaintiff succeeds in proving the cause in part for which the plaintiff is entitled to a decree in part in the suit and accordingly this Court hold that the plaintiff is entitled to recover compensation from the defendant No. 1 at an amount of Taka 1,06,250 along with simple interest @ 18% PA from the date of discharge of the cargo up-to the actual realization of the decreetal dues.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Fazlur Rahman &amp; Co Private Ltd. vs &lsquo;MV Chosun Hopi&rsquo; </em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Section 6- </strong>Since the plaintiff has taken delivery of the cargo after the free time, the plaintiff is responsible for his own negligence and the defendants is completely immune from any liability which may be occurred due to the hole in the container allegedly damaging the goods therein. Therefore, this Court finds that the plaintiff failed to prove the allegation that the defendants are liable for any damage caused to the household articles of the plaintiff which was carried by the container from the port of Baltimore to the Port of Chittagong by the defendant&rsquo;s vessel.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Mizanur Rahman Khan vs American Liner Systems, USA&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>ADMIRALTY COURT ACT, 2000</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Section 4(4)- </strong>Beneficial ownership -Action in personem- Action in rem- Having regard to the provisions of the Admiralty Courts Act and the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and on consideration of the decisions cited, the court has no doubt that the vessels &lsquo;MV X-Press&rsquo; Manaslu and &lsquo;MV X-Press&rsquo; Resolve cannot be arrested for security of the plaintiff&rsquo;s claims, for, the claims in the suit cannot be enforced in an action in rem against the vessels owned by stranger to the dispute.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>HRC Shipping Ltd vs MV X-Press Manaslu, MV X-Press Resolve&nbsp; </em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Section 24-</strong> It is contended on behalf of the decree-holder-petitioner that the admiralty suit has been decreed long ago but yet the judgment debtors have paid but a negligible amount of the decretal amount and also they have come with the applications for permission to sell the attached and mortgaged properties of the judgment debtor to realize decretal amount though the sale of these properties would not satisfy the decree in its entirety.</p>\n\n<p>The jurisdiction of this Court is not derived from the Letters Patent of 1862 or that of 1865, but from the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act (India) of 1891 and the Court of Admiralty Act 1861 of England.</p>\n\n<p>The Admiralty Court Rules was framed in 1912 which was gazette in 12th June, 1912 and that rule is still in force in Bangladesh pursuant to the provisions of section 24 of the Admiralty Court Act, 2000. Section 24 of the present Act provides that until rules are framed under the new Act the Admiralty Rules which were in existence will be followed and admittedly no rule has yet been framed under the Admiralty Court Act, 2000. Therefore, the rules framed in 1912 under the provisions of the previous Act arc still in force and govern the procedure in the Admiralty Court.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Sonali Bank vs Bengal Liner Ltd. </em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Section 3(2)(Cha) of the said Act provides that Admiralty Suit shall be maintainable for recovery of compensation arising out of loss of or damage to goods carried in a ship. This Court finds that the cause of the plaintiff is squarely maintainable in this jurisdiction as such issue No. 1 is disposed of in favour of the plaintiff. This Court finds that as the ulage survey report confirms that the vessel had the quantity of 24,000 MT of CDSO and the same quantity of CDSO was discharged by the vessel in the lighter-age tankers which carried the same to the shore tanks owned by the plaintiff and therefore the plaintiffs suffered no loss or damage on this count. There being no short landing of the cargo from the vessel &lsquo;MT Trompeteros&rsquo;, the claim of the plaintiff as to incurring loss in respect of short landing has no substance to be considered by this Court. Moreover, since the adjudication made by the customs authority was not lawful, the plaintiffs have also not incurred any loss in respect of the customs Penalty which is not at all a liability of the plaintiff. Therefore, the question of business loss upon the alleged short landing does not come at all.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>S. Alam Vegetable Oil Ltd. vs &lsquo;MT Trompeteros&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Section 4(4)- </strong>Having, therefore, had regard to the referred provisions of section 4(4) of the Admiralty Court Act, 2000 and section 2 of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and having perused, in particular, this Court&rsquo;s previous order in Admiralty Suit No. 27 of 2005 that dealt with a similar dispute arising out of the same facts and circumstances, this Court is inclined to hold that the Order of arrest of 10-07-2007 of the vessels &lsquo;MV Lady Fatima&rsquo; and &lsquo;MV Da Li&rsquo; is not sustainable in law. It is at this juncture that this Court is additionally put on notice of the fact that of the two vessels subject to that Order of arrest, one vessel namely, &lsquo;MV Lady Fatima&rsquo; did not, in fact, call on and was not available at Chittagong Port at any material time. This Court has taken note of the fact, and as asserted in the supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of the defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 15, that in making the order of arrest on 10-07-2007 this Court possibly did not have the benefit of all relevant facts and circumstances of this case placed before it.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, the application is allowed. The Order of arrest of the vessel &lsquo;MV Da Li&rsquo; is hereby vacated and it is ordered that the vessel &lsquo;MV Da Li&rsquo; now berthed at Chittagong Port, Chittagong be forthwith released from arrest. In the light of the fact that the other vessel &lsquo;MV Lady Fatima&rsquo; had never been effectively the subject of the Order of arrest dated 10-07-2007, that Order of arrest to the extent that it applied to the vessel &lsquo;MV Lady Fatima&rsquo; necessarily also stands vacated.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>HRC Shipping Ltd. vs &lsquo;MV Lady Fatima&rsquo; and &lsquo;MV Da Li&rsquo; </em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Section 24- </strong>It is clear, however, that the plaintiff&rsquo;s claim has been proven in the regard only to that extent. The instant Admiralty Suit is thus liable to be decreed in favour of the plaintiff for a sum of Taka 32,28,703 equivalent to US $ 47,134.35 inclusive of cost ex parte against the defendant No. 1.

The notification set out above gives in details, in conformity with the powers conferred upon it by the Statute the limits of territorial waters of Bangladesh. The limits of the territorial waters has been fixed at twelve nautical miles measured seaward and has also defined the baseline giving the details set out in the notification mentioned earlier.</p>\n\n<p>It is patent that all the three trawlers ware captured from the places which clearly fall within the territorial waters of Bangladesh as defined by the notification issued by the Government under the statutory powers conferred upon it by the Territorial Waters and Maritime Zones Act 1974.That being the position, both the Customs Authority and the High Court misdirected themselves in assuming the power to decide what should be the limits of territorial waters of Bangladesh.</p>\n\n<p>The three trawlers were seized within the &ldquo;territorial waters&rdquo; of Bangladesh which is co-terminus with the &ldquo;Customs waters&rdquo; and hence their seizure was with jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>In the Customs Act though there is no specific mention of the Government, the language is plain enough to include the power of the legislature and Government to determine the appropriate baseline.

Where this onus has not been discharged it is not possible to hold that the goods were not shipped or the bill of lading was a forged document.</p>\n\n<p>Master of the ship is liable in case of transshipment&mdash;not the person further endorsing the bill of lading in favour of a third party.</p>\n\n<p>Even in cases where the hindrance of the ship&rsquo;s voyage is not caused by an excepted peril the ship owner is only liable for delay or failure to deliver and to compensate for terms more onerous to the shipper in transshipment.

The defendant company, relied on the foregoing clause in the bill of lading as relieving them (including the negligence of their agents and servants) of all liability for the loss of the goods and further relied on clause (c) of Article 1 of the Schedule to the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act under which cargo carried on deck are not governed by the provisions (vide para 8 of Article III) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and contended that a common carrier can contract out of all liability by special terms of contract such as the one set forth above.</p>\n\n<p>Held: General condition in the bill of lading as to the exemption for negligence does not help the ship owner.</p>\n\n<p>On the foregoing terms it cannot be said that the defendants have completely absolved themselves from taking any care of the goods of which they took delivery for carrying them to their destination. It may be that they were carried on deck but that does not mean that they will not take any care of these goods. They are to take such care as one can take of goods carried on deck and if they are carried under a stipulation even then they will take such reasonable care as a man of ordinary prudence would do of the goods that are on the deck.</p>\n\n<p>The duty of a common law carrier, generally speaking, is to take utmost care of the goods entrusted to him and he can only limit the liability of taking extraordinary care by certain special terms and contract.</p>\n\n<p>When goods are delivered to a carrier, they are usually no longer under the eye of the owner. If they should be lost or injured by the grossest negligence of the carrier or his servants or stolen by them or by thieves in collusion with them, the owner would be unable to prove either or these causes of loss. To give due security to property, the law has added to the responsibility of a carrier, which immediately arises out of his contract to carry for a reward that of taking all reasonable care of it.</p>\n\n<p>If the parties are to contract out completely as to their liability, even according to English Common Law they must do so in so many plain and unambiguous words. In other words, It is poen to the parties to even enter into terms of contract which will change the character of the common carrier altogether or destroy the character of a common carrier as a carrier.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Onus of proof is on the carrier where the goods are lost, even though there was the special condition of carrying the goods at owner&rsquo;s risk.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Trans-Oceanic Steam-Ship Co.

The bill of lading governing the relationship between the plaintiff and the company incorporated the provisions of Article 3, clause 6 of the Schedule to the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act which specifies the period within which a suit for damage must be brought against the company.</p>\n\n<p>Held: The effect of the incorporation of Article 3, clause 6 of the Schedule to the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act into the bill of lading is that the rights of the plaintiff company are extinguished as soon as the period provided therein is over.</p>\n\n<p>The words &ldquo;the carrier and the ship shall be discharged from liability in respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought within one year&rdquo; incorporated in the bill of lading mean that under the contract they will be totally absolved from liability if the suit was not brought within one year.</p>\n\n<p>Suit for damage is to be brought within one year from the date on which the cargo is discharged.</p>\n\n<p>Section 28 of the Contract Act does not hit the contract as embodied in the bill of lading nor does it come within the meaning of local or special law referred to in section 29 of the Limitation Act.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Holland Bengal Burmah Line vs Dawood Corporation Ltd. </em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The plaintiff at the time of shipment paid freight for the entire cargo covered by the bill of lading. On representation of the company that lighter may have to be used for unloading the cargo at the port of destination the plaintiff paid a certain additional sum at the rate of Rs. 20/- per freight ton to meet the lighterage and demurrage charge, if any. As the cargo carrying ship had not to take the help of any lighter to discharge the cargo nor had any demurrage been paid, the plaintiff claimed refund of the additional amount paid to the company to which the latter answered that the amount claimed was really a part and parcel of the freight agreed upon and, therefore, refund of amount cannot be claimed. The company in this connection relied on the endorsement under &lsquo;Freight&rsquo; in the bill of lading which was to the effect that Rs. 20/- per freight ton for lighterage and accordingly contended that the additional charge had been shown in the bills of lading under the rate and freight column and had been included in the total freight payable which implied that it was an additional charge.</p>\n\n<p>Held: The amount deposited at the rate of Rs. 20/- per freight ton was not a part and parcel of the freight. From the mere fact that this amount was mentioned in the bill of lading, it cannot be said that it was a part and parcel of freight.</p>\n\n<p>If the said sum was a part of the freight, the company could have easily mentioned it as such in the bills of lading.</p>\n\n<p>It is, therefore, evident that the company was not entitled to charge this additional amount as freight.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>M/S, Muhammadi Steam-Ship Co.

If agreed upon it is also paid in advance on shipment. Demurrage on the other hand, is a charge for delay in clearing goods at the destination by the consignee.</p>\n\n<p>In the absence of any specific term in the bill of lading about the responsibility of the shippers in respect of the damages caused by the detention, the duty of the shipper or his consignee or assign is to be reasonably diligent in discharging and receiving of the goods at the port of destination. What is reasonable time depends either on the custom of the port or on the facts of a particular case.</p>\n\n<p>The words &lsquo;lighterage&rsquo; and &lsquo;demurrage&rsquo; appearing in the bill of lading and the receipt are used in conjunction and support the contention that demurrage was to be charged in respect of and connected with the use of lighters. Amount charged under the head &lsquo;lighterage and demurrage&rsquo; was only to cover demurrage charges payable to the Port Trust authorities who burdened the shipowners if they&nbsp; stayed at the outer anchorage beyond the time allowed by them.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>PLR (1960) 2 WP 199.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The bill of lading is a document of title to the goods and may as such be transferred to a third party who makes it subject to everything that appears thereon. It is therefore, both transferable and negotiable. Usually as between carrier and shipper, the contract is contained in the charter party and the bill of lading is not evidence of the contract but only receipt for the goods and at the same time it is also a document which enables the shipper to transfer the goods to a consignee. Therefore, apart from the receipt, the bill of lading in such case is also a document of title.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Abu Bakr Siddique vs M. V.

Clause 9 of the bill of lading comes within the mischief of the third sub-paragraph of rule 5 of Article IV, which specifically requires that when the maximum liability of the carrier is fixed the minimum rate per package or unit must be pound 100, which is the figure representing maximum liability under the first sub-paragraph.

The second sub-paragraph states that, if a declaration of a specified value is made, it would be prima facie evidence as to the value of the goods, but such valuation would not bind the carrier who may prove that the goods were of lesser value. The third sub-paragraph requires that if a maximum liability per package or unit, as mentioned in the first sub-paragraph, is fixed by parties to the contract, such liability cannot be less than the maximum amount specified in the sub-paragraph, namely, pound 100.

It is at this juncture that this Court is additionally put on notice of the fact that of the two vessels subject to that order of arrest, one vessel namely &lsquo;MV Lady Fatima&rsquo;, did not, in fact, call on and was not available at Chittagong Port at any material time. This Court has taken note of the fact, and as asserted in the supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of the defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 15, that in making the order of arrest on 10-07-2007 this Court possibly did not have the benefit of all relevant facts and circumstances of this case placed before it.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, the application is allowed.

They further argued that &ldquo;landing&rdquo; in the notification has reference to land and there cannot be any landing on the surface of the buoys.</p>\n\n<p>Held: The goods might not be said to be landed if they were put there with the means and right of taking them up on to the land.

The market value of vessel will not be presumed to be her insured value, except in rare cases and the burden of proving the sound market value of the vessel at the termination of the policy will be on the plaintiff who claims on the policy. &ldquo;A contract of marine insurance is a contract of indemnity, that is, the amount recoverable is measured by the extent of the assureds&rsquo; pecuniary loss but it is never a contract of guarantee or a contract of compensation for damages.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Sadharan Bima Corporation vs Bengal Liner Ltd. and others </em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Section 55- </strong>Admittedly, the defendant issued the Insurance cover on 02-05-1983 on receipt of the first installment of the premium with the stamp duty. After issuance of the Marine Policy the Sadharan Bima Corporation cannot be heard to den payment of the amount covered by the insurance policy if the trawler capsized at any time after the insurance cover was issued on 02-05-1983. The trawler sailed on 02-05-1983 and capsized on 05-05-1983. The reasons assigned by the trial Court while deciding issue No. 3 against the plaintiff cannot be accepted. The Trail Court has kept out of consideration large number of papers which clearly indicate that the vessel sailed on 02-05-1983 and capsized on 05-05-1983. Non consideration of the aforesaid large number of documentary evidence by the trail Court has vitiated the impugned Judgment with regard to issue No. 3.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Sadaran Bima Corporation vs MA Halim </em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>MARITIME CONVENTION ACT, 1911</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>S. 1: </strong>From the evidence it appears that &ldquo;M.

But the Original Side Rules of the Calcutta High Court was framed under clause 37 of the Letters Patent, 1985 with the introduction of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1978 the Letters Patent has been repealed by section 3 of the said Ordinance. On a scrutiny of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1978, it is found that the Original Side Rules framed by the Calcutta High Court under Clause 37 of Letters Patent, 1865 have not been preserved by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1978. Thus the Original Side Rules died its natural death with promulgation of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1978.

The plaintiff asserted that collision took place at 5.30 AM on 13-05-1986. On consideration of the evidence on record it appears that plaintiffs by credible evidence have failed to establish that collision took place at 5.30 AM. Since the evidence brought on record by the plaintiffs is not of the kind wherefrom it can definitely be arrived at the finding that because of the negligence of MV Shainpukur-1 accident took place, in that state of the matter the High Court Division was quite correct in holding that plaintiffs failed to establish that the accident took place because of the negligence of the vessel MV Shainpukur-1.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Chalna Carriers and Fibers Ltd vs Shainpukur Navigation Ltd. </em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>UNIFORM CUSTOMS AND PRACTICE TO DOCUMENTARY CREDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Articles 2, 3, 4, 9 &amp; 16- </strong>The consistent view of the courts are that only in two exceptional circumstances an issuing bank can absolve its responsibility of not honoring the obligation created by it under a letter of credit- Fraud of which it has knowledge and special circumstances which warrant an interference by the court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Comforts Apparels (Pvt.)

The Provision of Civil Procedure Code for rejection of the plaint have not been made applicable to Admiralty Court nor the Rules of Admiralty Court provided for rejection of the plaint. Rather it is by invocation of inherent power of the Admiralty Court it has to be returned.

The High Court Division on consideration of the application of the petitioner observed that it did not show at all why the petitioner is likely to be affected by any such order of the Court in appointing a surveyor for inspection of the condition of the containers in question and found that no injustice would be caused to the petitioner due to the impugned order.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Shafi Motors Ltd. vs HRC Shipping Ltd. and other </em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Unless a suit is filed within one year after the delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered, the carrier and the ship shall stand discharged from all liability in respect of loss or damage.

(3, 'Arrest and Release', NULL, '<p id=\"myTitle\">SHIP ARREST OR RELEASE IN BANGLADESH</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>The High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh exercises Admiralty Jurisdiction under the Admiralty Court Act, 2000 and the Admiralty Rules, 1912. Admiralty Rules provide that in suits <em>in rem</em> a warrant for the arrest of property may be issued at the instance either of the plaintiff or of the defendant at any time after the suit has been instituted, but no warrant of arrest shall be issued until an affidavit by the party or his agent has been filed, and the following provisions complied with:-</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>The affidavit shall state the name and description of the party at whose instance the warrant to be issued, the nature of claim or counter-claim, the name and nature of the property to be arrested, and that the claim or counter-claim has not been satisfied.</li>\n	<li>In a suit of distribution of salvage the affidavit shall state the amount of the salvage money awarded or agreed to be accepted, and the name, address and description of the party holding the same.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To file an application for arrest of ship the plaintiff/claimant must institute a suit by paying Tk. 1,00,000.00 as Court fee. In a suit for wages Court fee of Tk. 100.00 is required to be paid. The plaint along with the documents is to be filed in the section/office of the Court and the application for arrest of the ship is filed in the Court. Usually, the application comes up in the Daily Cause List of the court on the following working day. However, if the Court is satisfied with urgency of the matter it prepares a supplementary cause list and hears the matter on the same day. If <em>prima facie</em> case in made out in support of the claim the Court Admits the suit and directs issuance of summons. Thereafter, the application for arrest is heard and if the court is <em>prima facie</em> satisfied about the merit of the application it passes an order for arrest of the ship for security of the claim amount. An application for arrest of ship is heard exparte unless a caution/caveat has been filed by the defendants. Shipowners are advised to file a caveat when a ship calls on to any port of Bangladesh and apprehends litigation to prevent wrongful arrest by fraudulent claimants or to minimize the quantum of security. In practice undertaking to give sufficient security to satisfy the claim is not required to be filed along with the caution/caveat, though the Admiralty Rules provide for such an undertaking. The order for arrest of ship is served upon the defendants by the Marshal of the Court on receipt of costs and expenses paid by the claimant. Likewise, cargo on board or any property belonged to any party can also be arrested by the Admiralty Court.</p>\n\n<p>The order for arrest can be vacated by the same court upon an application filed by the defendant on the ground that the ship was wrongly arrested. The defendants can also file an application for reduction of the quantum of security, but hearing of these kinds of application takes 1 or 2 weeks. When the ship is in hurry this kind of application is not generally advised. A ship is released from arrest upon deposit of the amount of claim in the Court or upon furnishing a local bank guarantee. An LOU issued by P &amp; I Club is not accepted in Bangladesh. After release of the ship upon furnishing bank guarantee an application for reduction of Bank guarantee can also be moved by the defendants, and if allowed a revised Bank guarantee would be furnished. The release order is also served by the Marshal upon receipt of Marshal&rsquo;s costs and expenses.</p>\n\n<p>If the ship is not got released by the defendants, the plaintiff can pray for sale of the ship <em>pendente lite</em> and the Court sells the ship through auction and keeps the proceeds with the Marshal which is paid to the plaintiff if the suit is decreed in his favour. If there are more than one claimant and the proceeds cannot satisfy the claims Court applies the English Law of priorities. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Neither the International Convention relating to Arrest of Seagoing Ship 1952 nor the International Convention of the Arrest of Ships 1999 has been ratified by Bangladesh.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>A ship could also be arrested, by the plaintiff in execution of decree passed by the High Court Division or a judgment passed by a foreign Court against the Owner of the ship. Under the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (popularly called CPC) a ship can also be attached before judgment in a suit <em>in personam</em>. In a suit <em>in rem</em>&nbsp;instead of arrest the Court can attach a ship before judgment if the ship is beached for scrap before institution of suit. Under the Bangladesh Merchant Shipping Ordinance (MSO) 1983 the Principal Officer, Mercantile Marine Department can detain an unseaworthy ship. Under the MSO the High Court Division can detain a foreign ship for damage caused in any part of the word to the Government of Bangladesh or any Bangladeshi citizen or company. This sort of detention being ordered upon an application no court fee is required to be paid and there is no time bar. The Principal Officer or Collector of Customs can detain a ship before such application has been made to the High Court Division. Under the Regulations for Working of Chittagong Port (Cargo and Container) 2001 the Chittagong Port Authority can detain a vessel until security has been given&nbsp;or the total amount is paid&nbsp;for the amount of damage caused and the Cost involved in removing the blockade of navigational channel.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>There is no separate freezing order other than arrest of a ship in an Admiralty proceeding or in an execution proceeding to enforce a decree. However, an order for injunction to restrain a party from scrapping or removing a ship can be passed by the Court.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>A ship could be arrested in an action <em>in rem</em> for any of the following claims:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>any claim to the possession or ownership of a ship or to the ownership of any share therein or for recovery of documents of title and ownership of a ship, including registration certificate, log book and such certificates as may be necessary for the operation or navigation of the ship;</li>\n	<li>any question arising between the co-owners of a ship as to possession, employment or income of that ship;</li>\n	<li>any claim in respect of a mortgage of or charge on a ship or any share therein;</li>\n	<li>any claim for damage done by a ship;</li>\n	<li>any claim for damage received by a ship;</li>\n	<li>any claim for loss of life or personal injury sustained in consequence of any defect in a ship or in her apparel or equipment, or of the wrongful act, neglect or default of the owners, charterer or persons in possession or control of a ship or of the master or crew thereof or any other persons for whose wrongful acts, neglects or defaults the owners, charterers or persons in possession or control of ship are responsible, being an act, neglect or default in the navigation or management of the ship, in the loading, carriage or discharge of goods on, in or from the ship or in the embarkation, carriage or disembarkation of persons on, in or from the ship;</li>\n	<li>any claim for loss of or damage to goods carried in a ship;</li>\n	<li>any claim arising out of any agreement relating to the carriage of goods in a ship or to the use or hire of a ship;</li>\n	<li>any claim in the nature of salvage of life from a ship or cargo or any property on board a ship or the ship itself or its apparel, whether services were rendered on the high sea or within territorial waters or inland waters or in a port, including any claim arising by virtue of the application by or under section 12 of the Civil Aviation Ordinance, 1960, (Ordinance XXXII of 1960) of the law relation to salvage to aircraft and their apparel and cargo;</li>\n	<li>any claim in respect of towage of a ship or an aircraft;</li>\n	<li>any claim in respect of pilotage of a ship or an aircraft;&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>any claim in respect of goods or materials supplied to a ship for her operation or maintenance;</li>\n	<li>any claim in respect of construction, repair or equipment of a ship or dock charges or dues;</li>\n	<li>any claim for wages by a master or member of the crew of a ship or any claim for any money or property recoverable as wages of master or member of the crew under the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983, hereinafter referred to as the Ordinance, or in the Court;</li>\n	<li>any claim for disbursements made on account of or for the purpose of a ship by the Master, shipper, charterer or agent of the ship;</li>\n	<li>any claim arising out of an act which is or is claimed to be a general average act;</li>\n	<li>any claim arising out of bottomry or respondentia;&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>any claim for forfeiture or condemnation of a ship or of goods which are being or have been carried, or have been attempted to be carried, or for the restoration of a ship or any such goods after seizure, or for droits of admiralty together with any other jurisdiction to grant reliefs as are provided under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>A ship could be arrested irrespective of her flag.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>As long as the claim gives rise to an action <em>in rem</em>, even if the ship belongs to a Foreign State the ship would be arrested. But the ships belonged to the Government of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Army, Bangladesh Navy, Bangladesh Air Force, Bangladesh Rifles, Bangladesh Police and Coast Guard are indemnified.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>A sister ship can be arrested in Bangladesh but an associated ship cannot be arrested. The Court can lift or pierce the corporate veil to determine the beneficial ownership of a ship.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>If the ship is on bare boat charter it can be arrested. When the ship is on time charter it can be arrested if there is maritime lien against the ship. If the claim arises during time charter ship could be arrested as long as the charterer is in control of the vessel.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>Counter security is not required to be furnished at the time when the Court orders the arrest of a ship. However, the code of Civil Procedure provides that where, at any stage of the suit, it appears to the Court that a sole plaintiff is, or (when there are more plaintiffs than one) that all the plaintiffs are residing out of Bangladesh, and that such plaintiff does not, or that no one of such plaintiffs does, possess any sufficient immovable property within Bangladesh other than the property in suit, the Court may, either of its own motion or on the application of any defendant, order the plaintiff or plaintiffs, within a time fixed by it, to give security for the payment of all costs incurred and likely to be incurred by any defendant.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>If the plaintiff&rsquo;s claim is a maritime lien, the claim survives notwithstanding the change in ownership of a ship and the ship can be subjected to arrest. If the claim is a maritime claim and not a maritime lien the ship cannot be arrested if before filing of the suit ownership of the ship has changed.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>Sections 477 and 478 of the MSO recognize maritime liens to the Seaman&rsquo;s wages and the Master&rsquo;s wages respectively. No other statute recognizes maritime Liens. However, Court follows English law of maritime liens.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>After receipt of file/documents along with Power of Attorney 48 hours time is required to obtain an order of arrest.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>Power of Attorney executed by the client, notarized and attested by the Bangladesh High Commission in the plaintiff&rsquo;s country is required to be filed along with other documents to prove the claim. But the Court permits to file suit by dint of the scanned copy of the Power of Attorney subject to filing the original after authentication by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and payment of stamp duty.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>All documents in support of the claim along with correspondence between the parties are required to be filed at the time of filling the suit and application for arrest. Original documents are required to be filed at the time of trial.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>Court usually accepts jurisdiction over the substantive claim once the vessel has been arrested. However, the Court may refrain from adjudicating the substantive claim if any agreement of jurisdiction stipulates for foreign jurisdiction. In case of pendency of maritime arbitration, court maintains the arrest order for the purpose of security and stays the substantive suit.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>After the expiration of 12 days from the return of a warrant if no appearance shall have been entered in the suit, the attorney for the plaintiff may cause the suit to be sent down for hearing on merit. But when the defendants enter appearance and contest the suit it takes 3 to 4 years to adjudicate the suit on merit.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>The Court does not acknowledge the concept of wrongful arrest for the purpose of counter security but it can vacate the order for arrest of ship on the ground of wrongful arrest. The court can award costs of the suit against the losing party. Moreover, if in any suit the defendant objects the claim on the ground that the claim or defence is false or vexatious and if thereafter, such claim or defence is disallowed the Court shall make an order for the payment to the objector, such cost by way of compensation which may extend upto twenty thousand taka.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>The Court does acknowledge the principles of piercing and lifting of the corporate veil. In order to obtain arrest by piercing the corporate veil, one need to establish that it is a deliberate attempt on the part of the ship owner to create different entities to avoid legal liabilities. If independent legal entities have been established in the normal course of business the Court would be reluctant to pierce the corporate veil for the purpose of issuing an order of arrest.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>Ship can be sold <em>pendente lite</em>. The process of sale could be completed within 2 to 3 months from the date of the order of arrest. It could take longer period if any aggrieved party challenges either the order of arrest or the order of sale before the same Court or before the superior Court.</li>\n</ol>', 1, '2018-07-26 10:44:08', '2018-07-26 10:44:08'),
